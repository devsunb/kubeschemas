If this is not specified, the default behavior is to reduce the rate limit counters by 1.\n\nWhen Envoy receives a request that matches the rule, it tries to reduce the rate limit counters by the specified number.

Since the reduction happens after the request stream is complete, the rate limit won't be enforced for the current request, but for the subsequent matching requests.\n\nThis is optional and if not specified, the rate limit counters are not reduced on the response path.\n\nCurrently, this is only supported for HTTP Global Rate Limits."
