  "description": "EncryptionConfiguration stores the complete configuration for encryption providers. It also allows the use of wildcards to specify the resources that should be encrypted. Use '*.\u003cgroup\u003e' to encrypt all resources within a group or '*.*' to encrypt all resources. '*.' can be used to encrypt all resource in the core group.  '*.*' will encrypt all resources, even custom resources that are added after API server start. Use of wildcards that overlap within the same resource list or across multiple entries are not allowed since part of the configuration would be ineffective. Resource lists are processed in order, with earlier lists taking precedence.\n\nExample:\n\n\tkind: EncryptionConfiguration\n\tapiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1\n\tresources:\n\t- resources:\n\t  - events\n\t  providers:\n\t  - identity: {}  # do not encrypt events even though *.* is specified below\n\t- resources:\n\t  - secrets\n\t  - configmaps\n\t  - pandas.awesome.bears.example\n\t  providers:\n\t  - aescbc:\n\t      keys:\n\t      - name: key1\n\t        secret: c2VjcmV0IGlzIHNlY3VyZQ==\n\t- resources:\n\t  - '*.apps'\n\t  providers:\n\t  - aescbc:\n\t      keys:\n\t      - name: key2\n\t        secret: c2VjcmV0IGlzIHNlY3VyZSwgb3IgaXMgaXQ/Cg==\n\t- resources:\n\t  - '*.*'\n\t  providers:\n\t  - aescbc:\n\t      keys:\n\t      - name: key3\n\t        secret: c2VjcmV0IGlzIHNlY3VyZSwgSSB0aGluaw==",
